```

### Key Information Now Displayed
1. **Original Steam Price** - Shows what each game costs individually on Steam
2. **Bundle Percentage** - Shows what percentage of the bundle cost each game represents
3. **Total Savings** - Calculates how much money was saved by buying the bundle
4. **Discount Percentage** - Shows the overall discount percentage of the bundle

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced `_calculate_weighted_costs` Method
```python
# OLD: return weighted_costs, game_to_app_id
# NEW: return weighted_costs, game_to_app_id, steam_prices, total_steam_value
```
- Now returns additional Steam pricing data for display
- Updated all error handling to return 4 values instead of 2

### 2. Enhanced `PriceBreakdownDialog` Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, games_with_prices, total_cost, purchase_type, parent=None, 
             steam_prices=None, total_steam_value=None, game_app_ids=None):
```
- Added optional parameters for Steam pricing information
- Maintains backward compatibility - old calls still work
- Automatically detects whether to use enhanced or standard format

### 3. Smart Format Selection
```python
has_steam_info = steam_prices and total_steam_value and game_app_ids
if has_steam_info:
    # Use enhanced format with 4 columns
else:
    # Use standard format with 2 columns
```

### 4. Enhanced Display Logic
- **4-Column Layout**: Game Name | Bundle Cost | Steam Price | Bundle %
- **Percentage Calculations**: `(game_cost / total_cost * 100)`
- **Savings Calculation**: `total_steam_value - bundle_cost`
- **Discount Percentage**: `(savings / total_steam_value * 100)`

## 📊 Use Cases

### When Enhanced Format is Used
✅ **Weighted Bundle Purchases** - When Steam pricing data is available
- Shows original Steam prices for comparison
- Displays bundle allocation percentages
- Calculates total savings and discount

### When Standard Format is Used
✅ **Multi-Purchase Bundles** - When user enters individual prices
✅ **Equal Split Fallback** - When Steam pricing fails
✅ **Any scenario without Steam data** - Graceful degradation

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Backward Compatibility
